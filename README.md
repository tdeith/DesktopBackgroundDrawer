DesktopBackgroundDrawer
=======================

A relatively ambitious project to procedurally generate pretty images where constraints are placed on the uniqueness of each pixel's R,G,B value. Several methods of assigning colours to pixels are contained: some are highly random, some sorted; some have greedy pixels, some greedy colours; some enforce strictly unique RGB values for each pixels, but you can allow non-unique values if fuller colour pallates at specific resolutions is desirable.

Eventually, I should add a GUI to this thing.
